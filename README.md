# TilingGlia
Automated pipeline to quantify cortex glia morphology and aberrant astrocyte infiltration in confocal images of drosophila larval VNC.

This tutorial guides you through the pipeline for quantifying cortex glia globularity and aberrant astrocyte infiltration into the cortex:

Step 1: Denoising
Step 2: Thresholding
Step 3A: Quantifying Globularity
Step 3B: Quantifying Infiltration

Please see the accompanying paper Quantifying glial-glial tiling using automated image analysis for a full description of the pipeline. 
Test data for the tutorial can be downloaded at The Cell Image Library http://www.cellimagelibrary.org/home.
