# TilingGlia

The tutorial on this repo guides you through the automated pipeline for quantifying cortex glia morphology and aberrant astrocyte infiltration into the cortex in confocal images of drosophila larval VNC. Please see the accompanying paper "Quantifying glial-glial tiling using automated image analysis" for a full description of the pipeline.
